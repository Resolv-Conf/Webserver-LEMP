# Webserver-LEMP
Quick LEMP Stack Setup script to install LEMP as Nginx MySQL PHP all in one installation and keeps it simple for other to install the webserver with little to no issues 


Make Sure you run this as root 

once you get the script installed you want to give the script to run as a exacuteable 
chmod +x Webserver.sh
make sure you have a FQDN (Domain) for the certbot to work and make the domain for you work with the website 
this is one of the first scripts I made if you have any ideas for the script or any thing you suggest please feel free to contact me to add them 
thank you and enjoy
